# Ch3_ForceControl
The exoskeletonlifting_forcecontrol.ttt coppeliasim model itself has the python code attached as a non-threaded childscript. To run the model please have the latest version of Coppeliasim installed and simply run the simulation.
Upon running the simulation you can observe the lifting action done by a mannequin with a load held at hand level and exoskeleton at hip with arms connecting the trunk and thigh. Only sagittal plane is shown to illustrate a typical use-case.
Impedance controller was used to run this lifting action as the task involves a lot of continuous human-robot interaction.
